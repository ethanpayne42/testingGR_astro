# Testing GR while additionally modeling the astrophysical population 

Code release for "Fortifying gravitational-wave tests of general relativity against astrophysical assumptions" - Ethan Payne, Max Isi, Katerina Chatziioannou, Will Farr

The code base is simply a series of scripts which allow for the joint hierarchicla inference of the astrophysical parameters in additional to parameters governing the deviations from GR.
